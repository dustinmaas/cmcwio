			<br /><br />
			We offer unique skills and expertise that enable us to concept and build novel data comprehension solutions in literally any medium. Basically we make real-world things that talk to computers, that are useful and beautiful.    
			<br />{PROBABLY GET RID OF THIS LINE} We are currently in a prototyping and beta testing phase. For our first test we were tasked with developing and fabricating interactive art pieces to be displayed at Red Sky's annual Summit. Check back for more on that project.

						<br>software developer, builder
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						Brian is a polymath but certainly not a master-of-none. In his work as a software developer he has BLAH BLAH {fill in this later} highlighting his keen and intuitive understanding of systems. He has been noted for his graphic design and poster art. He is also a fine carpenter and metal worker as well as mathematician and amateur humorist.

						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						Dustin is an engineer. He loves to build things... and take them apart. He has designed and implemented systems that operate at the intersections of human need and bleeding edge technologies. At CMCW, Dustin is leveraging his hardware and signal processing expertise to help create beautiful and informative interactive data visualizations.</div>

						<br>classically trained artist 
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						James' expertise in information and communications technology, fine art, and business development are a perfect fit here. He enjoys collaborating with engineers and developers to bring to life artistic visions that just wouldn't be possible without new technologies, data science, and craftsmanship. He's plied his trade in the EU for several years, and now he's bringing his knowledge and skill-set to CMCW.

						There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
